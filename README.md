# NUMERICAL COMPUTING IS FUN

### A guide to principles of computer science and numerical computing for all ages

As much as this series is to educate aspiring computer programmers and data scientists of all ages, after playing with computers and numbers for nearly 4 decares, I've also made this as a reminder for myself on how to have fun with computers and maths.

Using Jupyter notebooks as the medium, this series provides an introduction to: 

- Computer Science
- Python programming language
- Numerical computing 
- Numbers theory 
- Prime numbers 
- Data visualization

## Part 1 : Introduction

Start learning [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokotila/jupyter4kids/blob/master/notebooks/numerical-computing-is-fun-1.ipynb).

What you will learn: 

- print() is the command to print something on the screen
- Math operations are very easy to perform in Python
- Python deals with numbers based on data types
- In Python there are two numerical data types; int and float
- Functions are powerful tools to easily perform various operations
- Functions may accept arguments (parameters) as input
- Functions are computer processes, and arguments are what is being processed
- It's very easy to create your own functions

## Part 2 : Prime Numbers

Continue learning [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokotila/jupyter4kids/blob/master/notebooks/numerical-computing-is-fun-2.ipynb)

What you will learn: 

- Prime numbers relate with divisibility
- Divisibility means that when one number is divided by other, the product is not a whole number
- A prime number is any number that is divisible only by itself and 1
- Binary means 0 and 1
- Boolean logic is the binary language of computers
- Python gives us an easy to use way to instruct computers
- Boolean logic statements involve 'is', 'is not', 'and' and 'or' statements
- Boolean statements can be joined together
- Boolean statements always return either True or False as output
- It's easy to perform computing operations with small numbers
- The biggest prime number is a really big number
- Very big numbers require vast networks of computers joined together
